# tRNet
Training and interpretation of tRNet convolutional neural network predicting tRNA gene activity from ChIP-seq peaks.

## Overview
tRNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecturally based on BPNet ([GitHub](https://github.com/kundajelab/bpnet), [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00782-6). The model is aimed at specifically predicting the transcriptional activity of tRNA genes (transcribed by RNA Polymerase III) by using ChIP-seq data to determine the activity status of predicted tRNA genes in different cellualr contexts. The architecture and overview of the model and training are shown below.
